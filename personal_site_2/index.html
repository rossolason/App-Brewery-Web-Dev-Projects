          <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a senior software engineer at a startup working on
            advancing renewable energy technologies. We're hiring other
            passionate engineers too!

          <h3>SpaceX - Starlink</h3>
          <p>
            From 2019-2022, I was a solar array engineer working on SpaceX's
            Starlink satellites. In this role, I was responsible for the
            operation and health monitoring of more space solar arrays than any
            other human in history!

          <h3>SpaceX - Crew Dragon</h3>
          <p>
            From 2013-2019, I was a structures engineer working on the crew
            Dragon capsule. I designed most of the structural components in the
            capsule service section, including the structures repsonsible for
            reacting the thrust of all SuperDraco abort motors.

          <h3>Education and FSAE</h3>
          <p>
            From 2009-2013, I studied mechanical engineering at the University
            of Washington. I was the drivetrain lead and one of the drivers for
            the UW FSAE racecar team. In my senior year, we won one of the two
            US competitions. We also built the first electric car in team
            history.
